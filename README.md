# My Data Science Roadmap

In this repository I'll be documenting my development in data science skills. As I progress my reading of the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning - with Applications in Python](https://www.statlearning.com), this is an open source book written and made available by Professors of the Stanford University.

So far, here are the projects I've done in order to practice what I've learned reading the book:

- [Predicting Health Care Costs](lr-health-costs) - a Linear Regression Model
